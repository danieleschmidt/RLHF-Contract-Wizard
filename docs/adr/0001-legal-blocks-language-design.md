# ADR-0001: Legal-Blocks Language Design

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-01-15

## Context
RLHF-Contract-Wizard requires a domain-specific language (DSL) for expressing legal constraints and behavioral specifications that can be both human-readable and machine-verifiable. The language must bridge the gap between legal requirements, AI safety specifications, and formal verification systems.

## Decision
We will implement Legal-Blocks as a Python-embedded DSL with the following characteristics:

1. **Decorator-based syntax** using `@LegalBlocks.specification()` for natural integration with Python code
2. **Formal logic foundation** based on first-order logic with extensions for temporal reasoning
3. **Multi-target compilation** to Z3 SMT-LIB, Lean 4 theorem proving, and natural language documentation
4. **Constraint types**: REQUIRES (preconditions), ENSURES (postconditions), INVARIANT (always true), FORALL/EXISTS (quantifiers)

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Developer-friendly**: Python developers can adopt without learning new syntax
- **Formal verification**: Direct compilation to Z3/Lean enables mathematical proofs
- **Legal compliance**: Natural language output helps with regulatory documentation
- **Type safety**: Python type hints provide static analysis capabilities
- **Tool integration**: Works with existing Python tooling (IDE support, linting, testing)

### Negative Consequences
- **Python dependency**: Cannot be used independently from Python runtime
- **Limited expressiveness**: Some advanced temporal logic patterns require workarounds
- **Performance overhead**: Runtime constraint checking adds computational cost
- **Learning curve**: Developers need to understand formal logic concepts

### Risks
- **Verification complexity**: Complex constraints may cause SMT solver timeouts (Mitigation: constraint decomposition and timeout handling)
- **Semantic gaps**: Mismatch between Python semantics and formal logic (Mitigation: comprehensive test suite and formal semantics documentation)

## Implementation Notes

### Core Language Constructs
```python
@LegalBlocks.specification("""
    REQUIRES: precondition_expression
    ENSURES: postcondition_expression  
    INVARIANT: always_true_expression
    FORALL variable IN domain: quantified_expression
    EXISTS variable IN domain: existential_expression
""")
def constraint_function(params):
    return implementation
```

### Compilation Targets
1. **Z3 SMT-LIB**: For automated constraint solving
2. **Lean 4**: For interactive theorem proving
3. **Natural Language**: For human-readable documentation
4. **Runtime Checks**: For development and testing

### Type System
- Leverages Python type hints for variable typing
- Custom types for contract-specific domains (stakeholders, actions, states)
- Gradual typing with runtime validation fallbacks

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Standalone DSL with custom parser
**Description**: Create a completely new language with custom syntax
**Pros**: Maximum expressiveness, no Python dependency, optimized for formal verification
**Cons**: High development overhead, new tooling required, adoption barrier
**Reason for rejection**: Too much implementation effort for uncertain adoption benefits

### Option 2: Direct Z3/Lean integration
**Description**: Write constraints directly in Z3 SMT-LIB or Lean syntax
**Pros**: Maximum formal verification power, no semantic translation layer
**Cons**: Extremely high learning curve, poor Python integration, no runtime checking
**Reason for rejection**: Too specialized for typical Python developers

### Option 3: YAML/JSON configuration files
**Description**: Express constraints in structured data formats
**Pros**: Language-agnostic, easy parsing, good tooling support
**Cons**: Limited expressiveness, no type checking, poor developer experience
**Reason for rejection**: Insufficient expressiveness for complex logical constraints
