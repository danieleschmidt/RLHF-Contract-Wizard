1. **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Brief description`
2. **Description**: Detailed vulnerability description
3. **Impact**: Potential security impact
4. **Reproduction**: Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
5. **Fix**: Suggested remediation (if known)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Resolution**: Target 30 days for critical issues

### Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure:

1. **Private Disclosure**: Report sent to security team
2. **Confirmation**: We confirm and investigate
3. **Fix Development**: Patch developed and tested
4. **Coordinated Release**: Security advisory and patch released

## Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Security

**Critical Areas**:
- Contract upgrade mechanisms
- Multi-signature wallet integrations
- Gas optimization attacks
- Reentrancy vulnerabilities
- Integer overflow/underflow

**Security Practices**:
- All contracts undergo formal verification
- Third-party security audits required
- Testnet deployment before mainnet
- Emergency pause mechanisms
- Time-locked upgrades

### AI Model Security

**Threat Vectors**:
- Adversarial inputs to reward functions
- Model extraction attacks
- Poisoning of training data
- Contract manipulation via model outputs

**Mitigations**:
- Input sanitization and validation
- Differential privacy for sensitive data
- Formal verification of reward properties
- Multi-stakeholder consensus requirements

### Infrastructure Security

**Components**:
- JAX computation security
- Blockchain node security
- IPFS storage security
- API endpoint protection

**Best Practices**:
- End-to-end encryption
- Zero-trust architecture
- Regular security audits
- Incident response procedures

## Security Audits

### Third-Party Audits

We engage security firms for:
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Before mainnet deployment
- **Penetration Testing**: Infrastructure and APIs
- **Code Reviews**: Critical path security analysis
- **Cryptographic Review**: Verification protocols

### Bug Bounty Program

**Scope**: Production smart contracts, core libraries, infrastructure
**Rewards**: $100 - $50,000 based on severity
**Platform**: [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/rlhf-contracts)

**Severity Levels**:
- **Critical** ($10,000 - $50,000): Complete system compromise
- **High** ($5,000 - $10,000): Significant security impact
- **Medium** ($1,000 - $5,000): Moderate security risk
- **Low** ($100 - $1,000): Minor security issue

## Security Tools

### Automated Security

- **Smart Contract**: Slither, MythX, Securify
- **Dependencies**: Snyk, Safety, npm audit
- **SAST**: CodeQL, Semgrep, Bandit
- **DAST**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite

### Monitoring

- **Real-time**: Contract event monitoring
- **Anomaly Detection**: Unusual transaction patterns
- **Compliance**: Automated violation detection
- **Incident Response**: Automated alerting and rollback

## Compliance & Standards

### Regulatory Compliance

- **GDPR**: Personal data protection
- **SOC 2**: Security controls and procedures
- **NIST**: Cybersecurity framework
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management

### Industry Standards

- **OpenChain**: Supply chain compliance
- **FIDO**: Authentication standards
- **OAuth 2.0**: Authorization framework
- **TLS 1.3**: Transport layer security

## Emergency Response

### Incident Response Plan

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and manual reporting
2. **Assessment**: Severity classification and impact analysis
3. **Containment**: Immediate threat mitigation
4. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis
5. **Recovery**: System restoration and validation
6. **Post-Incident**: Lessons learned and improvements

### Emergency Contacts

- **Security Team**: security@rlhf-contracts.org
- **24/7 Hotline**: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX
- **PagerDuty**: Critical infrastructure alerts

### Circuit Breakers

**Automated Responses**:
- Contract pause on violation threshold
- Model rollback on compliance failure
- Traffic throttling on anomaly detection
- Emergency shutdown procedures

## Security by Design

### Development Practices

- **Threat Modeling**: For all new features
- **Security Reviews**: Required for all PRs
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection

### Architecture Principles

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights
- **Fail Secure**: Secure failure modes
- **Zero Trust**: Verify all requests

## Training & Awareness

### Security Training

- **Secure Coding**: For all developers
- **Smart Contract Security**: Blockchain-specific training
- **Incident Response**: Team response procedures
