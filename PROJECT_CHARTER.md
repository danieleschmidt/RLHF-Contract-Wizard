# RLHF-Contract-Wizard Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: RLHF-Contract-Wizard  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Project Manager**: Daniel Schmidt  
**Status**: Active Development  

## Problem Statement

Current RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) systems lack formal mechanisms for encoding legal compliance, stakeholder agreements, and safety constraints directly into reward functions. This creates several critical gaps:

1. **Legal Compliance Gap**: No standardized way to ensure AI systems comply with regulatory requirements
2. **Stakeholder Alignment Gap**: Difficulty balancing competing interests of multiple stakeholders
3. **Auditability Gap**: Lack of immutable audit trails for AI decision-making processes
4. **Verification Gap**: No formal methods to prove safety properties of reward functions
5. **Evolution Gap**: No mechanisms for democratic contract amendment and evolution

## Project Vision

**Vision Statement**: "Enable the creation of legally-binding, machine-verifiable contracts that govern AI systems, ensuring safe, auditable, and stakeholder-aligned artificial intelligence."

**Mission**: To provide the definitive framework for encoding RLHF reward functions as smart contracts, bridging the gap between AI safety research, legal compliance, and practical deployment.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Legal-Blocks DSL**: Domain-specific language for expressing legal constraints
- **JAX Integration**: High-performance reward modeling and PPO implementation

- **Multi-Stakeholder Support**: Democratic governance and preference aggregation
- **OpenChain Compliance**: Industry-standard model card generation
- **Monitoring & Compliance**: Real-time violation detection and automated responses

### Out of Scope
- **General Purpose Smart Contracts**: Focus is specifically on RLHF contracts
- **Alternative ML Frameworks**: Primary focus on JAX, with adapters for others
